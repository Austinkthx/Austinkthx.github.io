            <p>I am primarily a healthcare professional with 14 years experience. In 2017 I began my programming journey by tutoring trigonometry and basic python skills at St. Petersburg college in Florida. I graduated Full Sail Univeristy in 2023 with a bachelors in Simulation and Visualization. Afterwards I enrolled in their machine learning bachelors which I completed most of and then dropped out in order to start a micro SaaS business for health and fitness applications on the mobile market. I also study cybersecurity and web development on my free time. My skills in anatomy and medicine have greatly improved as well since studying engineering.</p>
